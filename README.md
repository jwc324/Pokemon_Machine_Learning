Final Project for Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp

## SEGMENT 1 	 	 				

### __Presentation__
**Selected topic**
 - Storytelling through the data exploration of 7 Generations of Pokemon

### Why We Love This Project
- Pokemon has had a cultural resurgence in recent years, all leading to the 25th Anniversary of Pokemon in October 2021.  Already a cultural phenomenon in itself, in 2021, the franchise is celebrating a milestone anniversary while consumers are yearning for nostalgia and simple pleasures.  We're taking a look at how the original Pokedex has evolved across 7 Generations. _Pun intended._

### About the Data
<p align="center">
  [Link to original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420)
</p>
- This is a robust dataset containing the entire catalogue of the Pokemon universe broken down by the following details:
  - Pokedex Data - a catalogue of all detailed Pokemon species and features  
  - Base Stats Data - each individual value that determines a Pokemon's skills, strengths, weaknessess and overall abilities  
  - Training Data -  quantifed efforts for leveling up, upskilling and evolving your pokemon
  - Breeding Data - detailed data on which types of Pokemon species can breed and what they evolve into   
  - Type Defenses Data - data that determines a Pokemon's resistance against physical attacks

### Data Use-Cases				
Showcase a data-led retrospective on 7 Generations of Pokemon.  
**Starter** questions:
1. **Exploration of the characters.**  Show the distribution of _____ with each generation:
- Types
- Gender
- Abilities
- How to visualize?

2. **Collecting them all.** How does gameplay change with each generation? Compare ____ across generations:
- Catch-rates
- Egg-cycles
- Base Experience
- How to visualize?

3. **Fun Facts!**
- How many Pokemon do not have evolutions?
-- What is their species make-up?
- Who are the top 10% unfriendliest Pokemon?
- Who are the top 10% friendliest Pokemon?
-- Are there any trends here? Gender/Type/Species
--* Any other features at all - the list is endless

4. **What's your Pokemon's aura?**
- [Shirley Wu - Film Flowers inspo?](https://shirleywu.studio/filmflowers/)

5. **Interactive Sandbox**
- Build your own pokemon? 
Enter base stats and use machine learning to categorize your new pokemon by type
-- would need to know:
--- Are there correlations between base stats and the primary type of pokemon? If not, what correlations can we pull? maybe type vs these base stats. [example](https://www.kaggle.com/anhiva/pok-mon-group-classifier?scriptVersionId=40305036&cellId=15)
