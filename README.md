## SEGMENT 1 	 	 				

### __Presentation__
**Selected topic**
 - Storytelling through the data exploration of 7 Generations of Pokemon

### Why We Love This Project
- Pokemon has had a cultural resurgence in recent years, all leading to the 25th Anniversary of Pokemon in October 2021.  Already a cultural phenomenon in itself, in 2021, the franchise is celebrating a milestone anniversary while consumers are yearning for nostalgia and simple pleasures.  We're taking a look at how the original Pokedex has evolved across 7 Generations. _Pun intended._

### About the Data
- This is a robust dataset containing the entire catalogue of the Pokemon universe broken down by the following details:
  - Pokedex Data - a catalogue of all detailed Pokemon species and features  
  - Base Stats Data - each individual value that determines a Pokemon's skills, strengths, weaknessess and overall abilities  
  - Training Data -  quantifed efforts for leveling up, upskilling and evolving your pokemon
  - Breeding Data - detailed data on which types of Pokemon species can breed and what they evolve into   
  - Type Defenses Data - data that determines a Pokemon's resistance against physical attacks

### Data Use-Cases				
Showcase a data-led retrospective on 7 Generations of Pokemon.  
**Starter** questions:
1. **Exploration of the characters.**  Show the distribution of _____ with each generation:
- Types
- Gender
- Abilities
- How to visualize these changes over time?
- Potential Precedent: [The Evolution of the US Census](https://pudding.cool/2020/03/census-history/)
- Potential Precedent: [Scientific Proof that Americans are Completely Addicted to Trucks](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-auto-sales/)

2. **Collecting them all.** How does gameplay change with each generation? Compare ____ across generations:
- Catch-rates
- Egg-cycles
- Base Experience
- How to visualize?

3. **Fun Facts!**
- How many Pokemon do not have evolutions?
-- What is their species make-up?
- Who are the top 10% unfriendliest Pokemon?
- Who are the top 10% friendliest Pokemon?
-- Are there any trends here? Gender/Type/Species
--* Any other features at all - the list is endless

4. **What's your Pokemon's aura?**
- [Shirley Wu - Film Flowers inspo?](https://shirleywu.studio/filmflowers/)

5. **Interactive Sandbox**
- Build your own pokemon?
Enter base stats and use machine learning to categorize your new pokemon by type
-- would need to know:
--- Are there correlations between base stats and the primary type of pokemon? If not, what correlations can we pull? maybe type vs these base stats. [example](https://www.kaggle.com/anhiva/pok-mon-group-classifier?scriptVersionId=40305036&cellId=15)

**Slides**
Presentations are drafted in Google Slides. 
					
Github (10)
		 	 	 		
Master Branch
All code in the master branch is production-ready.				
The master branch should include: 
✓ All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
✓ Some code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project
README.md
README.md must include:
✓ Description of the communication protocols
✓ Outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest)	
Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.				
Individual Branches
✓ At least one branch for each team member
✓ Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the second segment (eight total commits per person) 			

Machine Learning Model (30)
		 	 	 		
Team members submit the code for their machine learning model, as well as the following:
						
✓ Description of preliminary data preprocessing
✓ Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision- making process					
✓ Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
✓ Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits 
					
Database (30)
		 	 	 		
Team members present a fully integrated database.
						
✓ Database stores static data for use during the project
✓ Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database connects to the model)					
✓ Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)
✓ Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
✓ Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)				
Note: If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships. 
					
Notes:
Load PostGres
Connect to a Jupyter Notebook
Merge two tables
I think we can split our 1 table into two tables and re-merge it back with postgres

Dashboard (15)
		 	 	 		
A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following:
						
✓ Storyboard on Google Slide(s) (presentation shell)
✓ Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create final dashboard
✓ Description of interactive element(s)
